# Intuition
- its similar than this [code](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)
- I used two pointer technique
- the left and right has the same logic.

# Approach
- keep track of left and right.
- direction - height
    - if the current is the biggest height, it return zero.
    - only if its less than the actual, it accumulate to the sum.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
n
- Space complexity:
1

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
         # Two-pointer approach to calculate the amount of water trapped.
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
        water_trapped = 0

        while left < right:
            if left_max < right_max:
                left += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                water_trapped += left_max - height[left]
            else:
                right -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water_trapped += right_max - height[right]

        return water_trapped
