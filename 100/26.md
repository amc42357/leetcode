# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

# Approach
- use one pointer to see if its different or not.
- iterate over all the elements.
- variation of two pointer techniques, assuming its consecutive because the problem definition and constrains
- using same array to save storage.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
n
- Space complexity:
1

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if nums is None or len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        
        unique_index = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[unique_index]:
                unique_index += 1
                nums[unique_index] = nums[i]
        
        return unique_index + 1
